## Requirements
**Update:** As of 08-03-2017 this code has been updated from Python 2.7 to Python 3.5.

This is to make it available to run natively on Windows TensorFlow installations ([Tutorial on how to install TensorFlow natively on Windows](http://www.jakob-aungiers.com/articles/a/Installing-TensorFlow-GPU-Natively%C2%A0on-Windows-10))

* Python 3.5
* TensorFlow 1.0
* Numpy 1.12.0
* Keras 1.2.2
* Matplotlib 2.0.0
